# Predicting-Course-knowledge-of-Student-using-Data-Mining
Predicting the students knowledge blooming level based on their performance in the continuous internal tests.

The objective is to predict the students knowledge blooming level based on their performance in the continuous internal tests. This prediction is done using association rule mining and regression
analysis. For this analysis,python and R programming tools are used. This helps the faculty and students to take necessary remedial actions to improve performance
in courses.

The Dataset used is Bloom's Taxonomy Cognitive Levels Data Set Available from Anwar Ali Yahya.

Bloom's Taxonomy was created in 1956 under the leadership of educational psychologist Dr Benjamin Bloom in order to promote higher forms of thinking in education, such as analyzing and evaluating concepts, processes, procedures, and principles, rather than just remembering facts (rote learning). It is most often used when designing educational, training, and learning processes.

There are six major categories of cognitive an processes, starting from the simplest to the most complex:

    Knowledge
    Comprehension
    Application
    Analysis
    Synthesis
